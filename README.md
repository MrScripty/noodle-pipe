# noodle-pipe
A cross-platform customizable node based pipeline automation tool.

Originally designed for accelerating game and film production workflows this graphical tool allows an easy way for both artists and developers to automate pipelines/tasks between any number of programs with an available Python API.

The current in-dev version of noodle-pipe is an early prototype based on Python 3.3 using tkinter. After the prototype has been user tested it will be recoded with updated system design specifications using PyQT4.x-5.x (LGPL).
