# noodle-pipe
A cross-platform customizable node based pipeline automation tool.

Originally designed for accelerating game and film production workflows this graphical tool allows an easy way for both artists and developers to automate pipelines/tasks between any number of programs with an available Python API.

The current in-dev version of noodle-pipe is based on Python 3.3 using tkinter, there will also be a PyQT5.4 (LGPL) implimentation after the basic UI functionality is complete. This is ment as a test to determine which package to use long term. Only one will continue to be developed.
